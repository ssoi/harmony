Experience
----------

**Data Scientist, Betterpath** (Feb 2014 to March 2016)

*    Served as project manager, developing and tracking of project milestones to ensure product met scientific needs of client
*    Developed queries (trigrams and PostGIS) and REST API for search of national provider identifier (NPI) database
*    Deployed NPI database infrastructure including writing Ansible roles, configuring Postgres, datababse migrations, and integration tests
*    Implemented extraction of text and text coordinates from PDFs (Apache PDFBox) and efficient search of keywords in large medical records corpus
*    Visualized and presented results of statistical analyses of integrated health system data to stakeholders and executives
*    Conducted and planned statistical analyses of health outcomes data from claims and health records
*    Prototyped business operations dashboard derived from Mixpanel tracking data for estimating efficiency of extraction process

**Statistician – Dept. of Surgery, University of Pennsylvania** (April 2013 to present)

*    Performed exploratory analysis of clinical outcomes from 4,200 surgeries (Whipple procedure), the
largest of its kind
*    Inferred surgeon- and institution-specific random effects to assess quality of risk-adjusted
outcomes following surgery utilizing linear mixed models
*    Developed a novel two-stage regression approach for identifying clinical risk-factors associated with multiple-outcome severity (Accordion grade) of postoperative morbidities following Whipple procedure

**Researcher, Dept. of Genetics, University of Pennsylvania** (May 2008 to Feb 2015)

*    Developed a novel method, combining Approximate Bayesian Computation and machine learning (gradient boosting machines), for estimating the time of divergence between populations while accounting for confounding factors e.g. population size changes and migration
*    Formulated and executed a research plan for the analysis of genome-wide polymorphism data from
*    840 individuals, statistically characterizing genetic relationships between populations and the role of factors such as geography in shaping genetic diversity
*    Implemented the quality control and statistical analysis of bisulfite next-generation sequencing data in 48 individuals to determine the influence of genetic and environmental variation on genome-wide patterns of CpG methylation
