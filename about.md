Hi, I am [Sameer Soi][www], data scientist at [Betterpath][bp], a company dedicated to helping
patients collect and engage with their medical records and ultimately navigate their chronic
conditions.

I obtained my PhD in [Computational Biology][gcb] at the University of Pennsylvania under the
supervision of [Sarah Tishkoff][tishkoff] and [Junhyong Kim][kim]. For my dissertation work I
applied a novel [Approximate Bayesian Computation][abc] approach to infer the history of African 
populations from genome-wide SNP data. I also identified regions of the genome with different
methylation patterns in sub-Saharan Africans practicing diverse subsistence strategies.
All my publications can be found on [Google Scholar][scholar].

I currently live in [Brooklyn][rambo] with my beautiful wife [Sonali][tyler]. 
I can be found milling about on [Twitter][twitter]/[Google+][google]/[Github][github].
